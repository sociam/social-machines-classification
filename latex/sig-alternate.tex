% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'

% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.

% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names

\section{Introduction (0.5 page)}

What are social machines and why are they important

An emerging, interdisciplinary field of research and development with a growing number of social machine instances and studies about them

We propose a classification framework for social machines. Targeted audiences

* research community: shared terminology, set of key features and their possible instantiations based on the analysis of a relevant set of 50 (?) social machines (both popular systems as well as long tail systems); facilitates the study of design and evolution patterns; supports research on how communities emerge and develop and organizational studies (mechanism design, incentives); different research approaches can be better compared and aligned.

* developer community: provides a theoretical grounding for the realization of new systems, informs system design and operation (what features should be implemented, what features are more important than others); enables predictions on user behavior and community development.

The framework is based on interviews with XXX researchers covering XXX systems and was preliminary evaluated with respect to ...


\section{Methodology (1 page)}

How was the classification framework defined

* interviews with XXX researchers on key descriptive features of systems they are familiar with

* consolidation of features listed for a resulting set of 50 (?) social machines

* grid analysis to identify groups of similar systems

* evaluation with respect to correctness, completeness, clarity, extendability in user survey, additional data set of XXX systems


\section{Classification framework (2 pages)}

First explain main principles: Distinction between application system and enabling technology; contributions, actions, activities, purpose, etc

\subsection{The Hierarchy/Polyarchical relationship of social machines}

While determining a set of social machines, one clear distinction was between social machine frameworks, such as MediaWiki and Ushahidi, which enable
social machines to be created, and instantiations of those frameworks into social machines that have been created for a specific purpose, such as Wikipedia
and Ushahidi Haiti. However, through further investigation, we discovered that the distinction between framework and instantiations was not the only
differentiator. Specifically, that some social machines could also have sub-machines or communities within them, that are working to solve different problems,
within the context of the larger machine. For example, Wikipedia is an instantiation of the MediaWiki framework, but there are a large number of
communities within Wikipedia that work on domain-specific areas, such as those contributing in areas of science and technology\footnote{Visualisation of Wikipedia Science Communities: \url{http://www.olihb.com/WikiCommunities/}}. However, we must also note that wikipedia is primarily split into communities of language, with the English, German and French wikipedias having the largest number of articles. It is therefore possible to analyse wikipedia into a hierarchy, from MediaWiki, to the languages of Wikipedia, down to the domain-specific communities. We explored this idea further, to include other social machines, and links where social machines utilise other social machines in order to function. For example, the social machine used by the Obama '12 US Presidential campaign~\cite{obamakieron}, which relied on social machines such as Twitter and Facebook. A resulting polyarchy is shown in Figure \ref{polyarchy}, which classifies levels as Infrastructure, Frameworks, Services and Causes/Groups.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Artefacts of Social Machines}

Our next observation was that there are a number of shared artefact types that can be classified within the context of social machines. Specifically that
there are ``intentions'' that motivate the use of social machines, ``actions'' that are directly performed by participants of social machines, and ``contributions``
that result from the use of social machines. We have taken these abstract concepts, and mapped them to a number of well-known social machines in order
to demonstrate that these concepts can be used to compare and contrast different machines.
